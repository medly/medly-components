# Contributing to medly-components

I am really glad that you are visiting this page. Thanks for your interest in improving medly-components.

This repo uses yarn workspaces, so you should install `yarn` as the package manager. See [installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

## Project setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn build` to build the packages, so that they will be available across the packages.
4. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> **Tip:** Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```properties
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/medly/medly-components.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master` branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch. Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.

## Development workflow

After setting the project, run yarn to fetch all the dependencies. Then, you can run several commands:

- `yarn clean` to delete `node_modules` and remove all linking across packages. If you do this you have to run `yarn` & `yarn build` to build the packages again
- `yarn storybook` to run storybook for local development
- `yarn lint` to run both css & ts lint
- `yarn watch` to continuously bundle the packages. This is helpful when you have linked any package with some local project.
- `yarn build` to build the packages
- `yarn test` to run tests and type check

## Unit tests

We are using [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) for writing unit test cases. We are trying to maintain 100% test coverage. So please make sure to add unit tests for the changes.

There are several test commands to help you run the tests:

- `yarn test` to run tests and type check
- `yarn test:update` to update snapshots
- `yarn test:jest` is used to run jest with all the compatible jest CLI commands like `yarn test:jest Modal --watch`
- `yarn test:watch` to watch all the tests

> **Note:**
>
> Please run `yarn build` before running unit tests. You have to run this command only once, but if your changes are spread across multiple packages then you have to run `yarn build` before running any tests.
