# HTMLProps

The `HTMLProps` utility constructs a prop type with the props extracted from an HTML element type. You can use it conveniently to extend HTML elements while preserving HTML props.

### Example

```ts
import { HTMLProps } from '@medly-components/utils';

export interface MyProps extends HTMLProps<HTMLLIElement> {
    disabled?: boolean;
}
```

**Note**: It is common while composing HTML elements in React to face this error: `Property 'ref' of foo is not assignable to target property.`. 
The `HTMLProps` utility resolves this issue as well.
