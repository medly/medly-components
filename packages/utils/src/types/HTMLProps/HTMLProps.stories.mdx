# HTMLProps

Constructs a type with the props extracted from an HTML element type.

#### Example

This utility type can be used as a convenient way of extending HTML elements while preserving props.

```ts
import { HTMLProps } from '@medly-components/utils';

export interface MyProps extends HTMLProps<HTMLLIElement> {
    disabled?: boolean;
}
```

**Note**: It is common while composing HTML elements in React to face this error: `Property 'ref' of foo is not assignable to target property.`. This utility resolves that issue as well.
