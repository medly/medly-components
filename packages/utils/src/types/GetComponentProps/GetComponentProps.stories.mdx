# GetComponentProps

The `GetcomponentProps` constructs a type with the props extracted from a React component type.

### Example

You can use this utility type as a convenient way of casting dynamically-formed structures into a type that makes it compatible with the props of some component.

```tsx
const multiSelect = <MultiSelect
    {...({
        ...baseProps,
        value: newValue,
    } as GetComponentProps<typeof MultiSelect>)}
/>;
```
You can use it to build composite prop types in situations where a new component shares a great degree of commonality with an existing one.

```tsx
type SparklyButtonProps = GetComponentProps<typeof Button> & {
    sparkleFactor: number;
    sparkling: boolean;
};
```
