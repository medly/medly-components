# GetComponentProps

Constructs a type with the props extracted from a React component type.

#### Example

This utility type can be used as a convenient way of casting dynamically-formed
structures into a type that makes it compatible with the props of some component.

```tsx
const multiSelect = <MultiSelect
    {...({
        ...baseProps,
        value: newValue,
    } as GetComponentProps<typeof MultiSelect>)}
/>;
```
It is also useful for building composite prop types in situations where a new
component shares a great degree of commonality with an existing one.

```tsx
type SparklyButtonProps = GetComponentProps<typeof Button> & {
    sparkleFactor: number;
    sparkling: boolean;
};
```
